## Penguino-STM32WL-LoRa-E5
 Seeedstudio's [LoRa-E5 STM32WLE5JC](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5-Wireless-Module-p-4745.html) module was recently announced, and I took the liberty of designing a Penguino Feather breakout board for it. Hopefully OSHW community would benfit from it. 


## About the Penguino Feather breakout
Managed to fit everything on a +2 layer (H1.6mm) low-cost PCB. Careful design choices allowed to have a good GND plane on the back to to achieve good (theoretical) RF performance.

_Current version: 0.1_

Board requirements are standard: 
- 6mil traces/clearance
- 0.3mm drill
